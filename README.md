# MLOps-Zoomcamp (2025 Cohort)

This repository documents my journey through the [MLOps Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp), a free intensive 9-week program by **DataTalks.Club**. 

---

The MLOps Zoomcamp consists of 6 modules and a capstone project:

### Module 1: Introduction

* What is MLOps?
* MLOps maturity model
* The need for MLOps
* Running example: NY Taxi Trips dataset
* Course setup and environment preparation

### Module 2: Experiment Tracking & Model Management

* Introduction to MLflow
* Experiment tracking with MLflow
* Saving and loading models
* MLflow Model Registry
* Practical integration in projects

### Module 3: Orchestration & Pipelines

* Workflow orchestration basics

- In 2022 & 2023 cohorts:
    * Building pipelines with Prefect 2.0
    * Turning notebooks into Prefect flows 
    * Deploying and scheduling flows 

### Module 4: Model Deployment

- Deployment strategies: online (web, streaming) vs. offline (batch)
- Deploying with Flask (web service)
- Streaming deployment with AWS Kinesis & Lambda
- Batch scoring for offline processing

### Module 5: Monitoring ML Systems

* Differences between ML and software monitoring
* Monitoring data quality, drift, and performance
* Tools: Evidently, Prometheus, Grafana, Prefect, MongoDB
